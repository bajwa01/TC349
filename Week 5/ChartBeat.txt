When I clicked on the website the first think I said was “impressive”. The page looks really clean and organized; the color combinations are perfect and very catchy. The animations on the page makes the user look at important information the website is trying to show. Another thing I have never seen on a webpage before is the count for pixels while scrolling down, which I thought was really cool. There is one thing that I thought was off about the page, I thought that home page was too long and should be broken down into more sub categories. The demo page is even more impressive and well organized. The live data bars and the graph makes it easy to look at the information. Users rather see the data in action than read about it. I really like their idea of giving users 30 day trial, I feel like after using it user would really enjoy the information about their page and it would make them buy the full version. This shows Chartbeat’s great marketing skills.
