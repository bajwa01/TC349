<h3>Instead of picking a wesbite that is already designed, I wanted to create my own website for my DJing business. I spent lot of time thinking what I wanted on my page and this is what I came with. The first image shows the original layout of the website that I thought of. It has sub menus of news, profile, music, photos and clothing store. Under news I would show my news feed from facebook and twitter and the next place I am going to play under it. Under profile it will show my personal data such as my concat information  and under professional it will show who I work with and such. Music menu will include my music, links to buy albums from itunes and podcasts. Photos will be organized by venues so it is easier for users to find pictures. I actually do have clothing with my dj logo on it, so I would like to sell that to my fans.  </h3>
<h3>After showing the page to my roommate he liked my idea but he wanted to change one thing according to page importance. He put my profile tab in the end because that is going to be the least used tab since users want to look at pictures and listen to my music first. Which I thought was a appropriate change.
