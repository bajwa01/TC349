<h3>I watched a lot of videos on youtube on sorting and looked at few different ways. I think the way I did it is very simple and makes it look very organized. First I started with the home page you get when you visit <a href="http://www.foldable.me">Foldable.ME</a> and under that I added the main menus. The first picture shows how the website is actually laid out. The second image is the changes I would make to the website. One of the change I made was to move the search bar to the home page, where it is easily visible and not have to look for it under other menu. The other change I made was to move the video to the top of the page on home page. I feel like it would be better if the users watch the video first before they start making their Foldable.</h3>
<h3>Lastly the third layout is what I had my roomate look at the page. The way he organized the page, It looks like he changed a thing or two on importance of the page. One thing he changed was to put the Tumblr sign up link at the bottom of the page. Over all I think the pages are very well layed out. There are not too many changes that should be made and without them the pages look good as well.</h3>
