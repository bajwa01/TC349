When looked at UnitedPixelworkers website the first thing that caught my eye was that bright colors that the website used. As soon as I moved my mouse I saw the boxes animate which I thought was really cool. Just by adding the little animation the simple page turns into interactive page.  While browsing through other subpages I noticed that all the pages had sub menus except the “roll call” page. Other than that my favorite page was the Roll call page because it is synced with instagram. It lets people upload their pictures and it shows up on the page, this shows the first time users that the brand is well known by people around the world.  Overall I though the design was very simple and nicely organized at the same time. I also liked the mouse over effects on the submenus, I have seen many websites where the menu would change color but on this page they added a horizontal bar that pops up on mouse over which I think is cool and different.
