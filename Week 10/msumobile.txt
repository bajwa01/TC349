I did not know that MSU had a mobile website and I have never heard it from anyone either since 98% of my friends have smartphones. I like the layout of the page it looks very simple and using it is even more simple. The page has most of the important information that it needs to have. One thing I would add to the page is “schedule” where students can check their current classes they are enrolled in or future classes that they are taking. Another feature I really like and never seen before on another mobile page is “customize home” icon. It lets the user put the most important icons on top or however the user likes. I also like the option of going to the full site mode which lets the user access everything as one would on the computer. I think the “events” icon should be just called calendar rather than having a date that is not valid, or change it so the date changes every day. After doing some searches in the provided search box, I find this very helpful because I am able to access a lot more other information than what the mobile page provides. Over all I like the design of the page, its kept simple and  does not heavy graphics which helps phones with slower processors to use the page efficiently .
