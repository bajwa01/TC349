
I took some time browsing through the Jason Santa Maria website and the first thing I noticed was that it is very organized and looks very clean. There is a good a mix of pictures, articles and video on the website which makes it more interesting to browse. I also like the how it is organized by dates which make it easier to browse and shows that the site is updated frequently.   
The few changes I would change if this was my website. I would freeze the top tabs so they stay in their position as the page is being scrolled down. It is frustrating to keep scrolling up when someone is reading a long article and they are the end. The background is too simple I would change the color or add some kind of image that goes with website theme or something catchy.  I would add a calendar on the side of the page to make browsing easily, instead of scrolling down or keep clicking next; it would be easier to just click on the day you want the articles to be displayed.
