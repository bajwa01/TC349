I decided to go with notepad and write in the HTML code. I took an html course in high school and from there on I have only used notepad. I have used other software such as Dreamweaver but I prefer to use notepad more because it helps me remember and keeps my memory fresh of the actual coding.  When the website has longer code and is more complicated I would prefer to use Dreamweaver because it is much quicker and it also looks for error in code. With html it’s hard and takes a lot of time to find the source of the problem if there is longer code since I would have to go through each line. One thing I have learned over time is to keep the code clean which makes it easier for other person to leave. I do not specify changes in the actual html file but instead I created a CSS file.  There are few changes that made to the site which I placed in the CSS file. Few things I changed were background color, text color, font and text alignment.
