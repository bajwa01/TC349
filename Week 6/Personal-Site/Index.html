  <h2>I was born in India and studied there for 10 years. I moved to Ann Arbor in 2002 and attended Pioneer High School. I decided to come to <a href="http://www.msu.edu">MSU</a> because of the great communication majors. I also wanted to do something along side business and decided to pursue my specialization in IT. I am also fluent in Punjabi and Hindi which is a great plus in the communication and business world.I am also part of few organizations such as Indian American Students Association (IASA) and MSU Bhangra. Bhangra is a traditional northern Indian dance, I am also the manager of the team. The team competes all over US and we have many trophies under our belt.  </h2>
