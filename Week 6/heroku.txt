Heroku is a very catchy website by the looks of it. The design is very unique from other websites, especially with the paper art icons they have.  After looking around I was very tempted to click on “how it works” link to see what exactly the website does. The step by step links makes it easier for users to find out what each step does. It is very cool how the diagram on the right shows the parts of the process in color. I like how the pricing page is very interactive; it lets you scroll the slider to see how much a service would cost after adding certain features.  My favorite page is the Add-ons page because it shows you the add-ons with pictures which I think is a great marketing process. I read an article few weeks ago that said an app’s downloads depends a lot on how it is presented. Even if the user does not want the app they would still read about it if it has a catchy icon.  Over this entire website is very well organized and has great animations. The idea of a cloud platform is new to me since I have never heard of it. I believe that this will be the new technology pretty soon.
