<h1> Website Critique</h1>
<h2>
<p> More and more people are giving up on Microsoft and switching to apple due to the sleek design of the computers but mostly for the software they make. I personally use a macbook for my music production and other productions software. I like how <a href="http://www.panic.com/">www.panic.com</a> only makes applications for apple products. The five apps they view on the main page are perfect for any web developer. The website is very clean and sleek and is user interactive such as mouse over zoom in. One of my favorite thing on the website is the access of older versions. This is the first website I have seen that will provide previous version on the main page than searching it on google, bing, etc.  They have also done a great job with providing help on their different products and specially about giving their address and phone number.</p>
