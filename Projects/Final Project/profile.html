<h2>I have many hobbies but my favorite one is being a DJ. After looking at my cousin make music and mixes for numerous dance teams I began to gain intreset in music and doing the same. Being a DJ is not only about  playing music for events but it is also a great way to make connections with people around the world. It is also a great leadership experience when it comes to promoting and Marketing. Once I stated to promote myself I got gigs outside of michigan. I have djed in Miami, Tampa Bay, San Jose, Dallas, etc. </h2>
