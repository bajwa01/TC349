<h2> I have been in the IT field for quite some time now. I have had plenty of real world experience in IT. I first started building computers for my friends in high school that led me to expand on the services I provided. Some of the services I provided were virus removal, system check, tune up, etc.</h2>
<h2>Last two summers I had a great opportunity to work with companies that offered great experience in the field of Communication and IT. I worked for <a href="http://www.sourcepro.com">Source Pro.</a> and <a href="http://www.ewie.com">Ewie Co</a>. I assisted the company's offices in other countries to network their computers to the company server. </h2>
