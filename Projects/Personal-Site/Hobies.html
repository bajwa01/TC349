<h2>I have many hobbies but one my favorite is being a Disk Jockey (DJ). when I was younger I watched my cousin make mixes for numerious dance teams. I started to like what he was doing and I sat down with him to learn often. I have been djing for many years and have done over 500 events. I started in high school djing the cultural shows and from there on I started to promote my self. I have many events including:</h2>
