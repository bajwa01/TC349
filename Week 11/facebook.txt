The website I use mostly on my phone is Facebook. When displayed on the computer, the full site shows the chat on the right and pages and groups I have joined on the left side. On the mobile device it displayes differently because if the layout was the same the text would be really tiny and it would look really crowded. On the mobile device it shows the birthdays first and then the news feed. All the other things such as search bar, messages, events, and pages are displayed under a menu on the left side. By adding least used features under a drop down menu makes the website look less cluttered. I don’t think this is a big deal but one thing I noticed about the Facebook was unlike other pages such as Google, Facebook does not allow the user to zoom in the page. By looking at mobile version and the full version on the cell phone I realized that it only lets the user zoom in if it the site is switched to full version. There are some changes that are limited in the settings area. I was trying to add job under the work section and add a school under education, I didn’t see any options where it would let me add any of those. There are some changes that can be made to improve the website but at the same time it should stay simple like the way it is now.
