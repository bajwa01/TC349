After visiting www.etsy.com  I saw that the website is very well organized. It looks very clean and no advertisement trying to get your attention than the website. After browsing around I figured that this website is somewhat like eBay and amazon, it lets the user buy and sell items. But etsy looks more of an art type of website. I see people are selling things that were made by them or something unique that can’t be bought at just any store. 
The tabs are very well organized and sub pages are clean as well. Website is very easy to browse for new users and lets you make quick and easy transactions. One thing I really like about the main pages is that it shows you the popular items that are being bought around the world. Also for quick use there is a mobile version of this website and after trying it on my phone it runs flawless and the mobile version is very neat as well.
