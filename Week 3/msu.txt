MSU page has come a long way since I started school in 2008. When I viewed it first few years ago there was no flash or anything interactive. It was also very hard to find things on the website but now it took a u-turn and now it looks very impressive. My favorite part of the website is the live search where the user types something in the search and it shows the closest results even before hitting the enter button. Also it is very organized with the tabs that separate the site into different departments. I also like the fact that MSU news shows up on the main page and shows present day events. 
MSU page is the first where they have the option to find current students and faculty. This makes it very easy to contact people and get a hold. I like the pictures that are viewed on the website that shows the connection MSU has with other communities around the world. The page also shows the recommend books that one would like.
