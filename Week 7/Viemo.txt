 I have heard about this website but this is my first time visiting it. Viemo is almost like Youtube but it is made for artsy people. I really like the background color; it is not too catchy and is easy on the eyes. I am not sure if the top background fits the theme of the website. I think the login area should be on either left or the right side, I think it looks really awkward in the middle. Something I really liked was the mouse over menu when mouse is over explore. I think by adding that feature it makes the website look simple and less crowded. One thing I would change about this website is the home page. The home page seems very long and I think it should be broken down into another sub menu. The main page should have  some type of intro video and a login area.   Specially the Viemo plus should have its own tab which I think will produce better results of new accounts of plus. Over all this website is well organized.
