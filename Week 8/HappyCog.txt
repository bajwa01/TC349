Upon opening HappyCog, my attention was caught by the bright salmon color. Making this this website was not too hard because all the data that is needed is on the same page and separated by sections. The cool part I really found was the use of internal links. Instead of scrolling down the page, internal links takes to certain sections of the page. At the same time I think the site should have been separated into different pages because of the amount of data that is there. When going to certain sections there is a button that lets you view more information about that section. I believe if that section had its own page it would look much cleaner and would give the developer more ideas on presenting the page instead of being limited in this situation. Also I like how their contact locations show the map, the user is able to just click on the map and find directions instead of copy and pasting the address into Google or such.
Over the entire website could use some work such as being divided into different pages but other than it still looks clean.
